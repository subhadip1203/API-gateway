# Project : Async API Gateway

this project is about Async API gateway. the main functinalities I am making are :
1. API Call Forwarding
2. Request Chaining
3. Response Data Cache


### Project structure:

I am testing different approaches . some of those are viable and some are not.
In the "old" I keep all the discarded options (I kkep those becase I may need to use some of the functinalities)
the "current" folder consists of current work


### How to run the project

1. Get into current folder : `cd current`
2. Install all nodejs packages : `npm install`
3. Edit config file : `config.js`
4. Run the projecr by : `node index.js`
